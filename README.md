# Uncertainty Estimation in Medical Imaging Using Regression U-Net

## Project Overview
This project implements the innovative approach introduced in a recent research paper for direct uncertainty prediction in a regression U-Net architecture, particularly focusing on medical applications. The model is designed to predict treatment doses and reconstruct the input image, using the reconstruction error as an indicator of model uncertainty.
